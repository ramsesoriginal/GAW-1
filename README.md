Game a Week - 1 

This is the first Game in my Game a Week project.
It took a bit over a week, mostly because of feature creep (i then removed most features to actually finish it), and also because
I had to build furniture, clean the whole apartment and drive from Berlin to Italy. Excuses, Excuses everywhere!

Anyway, it's an abstract local multiplayer downhill racing game. You race balls down a just-in-time randomly generated lane.
When there are splits in the lanes, the first player decides which way to go, the other lane gets closed, so be careful.
If you don't move for a while (you're stuck), you loose. If you fall out of the lane, you loose.
Winner is the last player standing.
The game is controllable with gamepads or keyboard (keyboard only for 2 player)
Single player mode not available.

Player 1 and 2 can use either keyboard or gamepad, player 3-6 only gamepad.
Keyboard controls:
  Player1: "a" and "d" to steer, "w" to accelerate, "s" to break/reverse
  Player1: "←" and "→" to steer, "↑" to accelerate, "↓" to break/reverse
Gamepad controls:
  Left analogue stick: movement

To confirm a choice, replay the game or resume after pause, press "space" or the "Y" button on the Gamepad.
To close the game or pause press "esc"
