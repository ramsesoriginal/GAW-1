Excuses, Excuses everywhere!*\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's an **abstract local multiplayer downhill racing game**.\r\n\r\nYou race balls down a just-in-time randomly generated lane. When there are splits in the lanes, the first player decides which way to go, the other lane gets closed, so be careful.If you don't move for a while (you're stuck), you loose. If you fall out of the lane, you loose. Winner is the last player standing.\r\n\r\n![Generated Lane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramsesoriginal/GAW-1/master/Screenshot/Screenshot2014-16-8--13-51-20.png)\r\n\r\nSingle player mode not (yet?) available.\r\n\r\nThe game is controllable with gamepads or keyboard (keyboard only for 2 player).\r\nPlayer 1 and 2 can use either keyboard or gamepad, player 3-6 only gamepad.\r\n\r\n  * Keyboard controls:\r\n      * Player 1: \"a\" and \"d\" to steer, \"w\" to accelerate, \"s\" to break/reverse\r\n      * Player 2: \"←\" and \"→\" to steer, \"↑\" to accelerate, \"↓\" to break/reverse\r\n  * Gamepad controls:\r\n    * Left analogue stick: movement\r\n  * To confirm a choice, replay the game or resume after pause, press \"space\" or the \"Y\" button on the Gamepad.\r\n  * To close the game or pause press \"esc\"\r\n\r\n![Game Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramsesoriginal/GAW-1/master/Screenshot/Screenshot2014-16-8--13-52-14.png)\r\n\r\nI provided Windows, Linux and MacOsX Builds (though I only tested the Windows Build, as I only have a Laptop with windows available at the moment), you can download them here:\r\n  * [Linux](https://github.com/ramsesoriginal/GAW-1/raw/master/Builds/Linux.zip)\r\n  * [MacOsX](https://github.com/ramsesoriginal/GAW-1/raw/master/Builds/MacOsX.zip)\r\n  * [Windows](https://github.com/ramsesoriginal/GAW-1/raw/master/Builds/Windows.zip)\r\n\r\nCamera movement is still a bit wonky, often buggy, and generally broken. Well, I did my best!\r\n\r\nI might work on this game a bit more in the future, but I have nothing planned.
